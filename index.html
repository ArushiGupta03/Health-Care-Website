    <h2>WHAT IS BMI?</h2>
    <P><b>BMI</b> is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between.</P>
    <h2>WHAT IS BODY FAT?</h2>
    <p><b>Body fat</b> includes essential body fat and storage body fat. Essential body fat is a base level of fat that is found in most parts of the body. It is necessary fat that maintains life and reproductive functions. The amount of essential fat differs between men and women, and is typically around 2-5% in men, and 10-13% in women. The healthy range of body fat for men is typically defined as 8-19%, while the healthy range for women is 21-33%.</p>
    <h2>WHAT IS BMR?</h2>
    <P><b>The basal metabolic rate (BMR)</b> is the amount of energy needed while resting in a temperate environment when the digestive system is inactive. It is the equivalent of figuring out how much gas an idle car consumes while parked. In such a state, energy will be used only to maintain vital organs, which include the heart, lungs, kidneys, nervous system, intestines, liver, lungs, sex organs, muscles, and skin.</P>
    <h2>WHY DO WE NEED TO CALCULATE THEM?</h2>
    <P>These are guidelines that allow nutrition and medical professionals to make educated determinations about your body composition and calorie burn. If a person is trying to lose weight, calculating their BMI, BMR or Body Fat could help them figure out how many calories to cut out each day. They are used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems.  It’s a good way to gauge whether you are healthy or not. </P>
